#CSSimg
This script converts an image into CSS for use in HTML

##Usage
Simply run the script providing one image as an argument. Currently, the script only supports jpg, jpeg, and png files

##Dependencies
Python 3.x and [PIL](https://python-pillow.github.io/)

###Drawbacks
Due to the nature of plaintext and how images are encoded, using this script produces a file about 900 times larger than the original image.
